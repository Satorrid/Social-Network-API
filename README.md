## Description
This is a project to demonstrate the use of NoSQL by building a social network API. Some of the functioinality includes creating a user, adding a user to your friends list, removing users from your friends list, Updating user information, creating thoughts, and deleting users. This is an unfinished project so I would like to be adding more functionality like user reactions. 

## Usage
This can be used as an API for social network apps.
